## **Units 9 - 11 Reflections**


The collaborative discussion on deep learning and generative AI helped me think more critically about the ethical impact of technologies like DALL·E and ChatGPT. In my initial post, I argued that while these tools offer creative and practical benefits, they raise important concerns around originality, authorship, and misuse. For example, AI-generated images or texts can be mistaken for human work, challenging traditional ideas of ownership and raising the risk of misinformation. I found that ethical concerns aren't just about accuracy, but also about how these tools are used and interpreted in real contexts.

In responding to my peers, I engaged with ideas around bias, plagiarism, and labour displacement. One peer highlighted how biased training data can lead to harmful outputs, which made me reflect more on the importance of dataset transparency. Another argued that AI tools are just extensions of human creativity. I agreed but pointed out that without proper regulation, they could be misused at scale. I also responded to a post about AI replacing creative jobs, noting that while automation is inevitable, we must advocate for new models of attribution and skill development.

This discussion taught me that deep learning in agent systems isn’t just a technical leap,  it’s also a social and ethical one. As future designers of intelligent systems, we must stay mindful of both.

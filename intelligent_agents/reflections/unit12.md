## **Unit 12 Reflections**


This final unit gave me the chance to look back at how much I’ve grown throughout the module. At the start, agent-based systems felt abstract and unfamiliar. Now, I can confidently analyse different architectures, apply agent techniques to real problems, and reflect on their ethical and social impact. The team project in Unit 6 stands out as a turning point where I applied theory in a practical setting and grew as a leader.

I also became more comfortable combining symbolic and learning-based approaches, especially when building my final research agent. Most of all, I’ve developed a stronger sense of what it means to be a responsible AI practitioner. This module challenged me to think critically, work collaboratively, and approach intelligent system design with care, clarity, and purpose.

## **Units 5 - 7 Reflections**


In these units, the focus shifted to how agents interact and share knowledge. I learned that communication protocols such as KQML and FIPA ACL are not just syntactic tools, but they also define the semantics of cooperation. The collaborative discussion pushed me to consider how misunderstandings or ambiguity in agent messages could compromise system integrity or lead to cascading failures.  I also compared their use with that of traditional programming languages, such as Python. My peers communicated the advantages and disadvantages of ACLs, and that knowing what context or domain to use them is vital. 

This reflection also extended into legal and ethical territory. If autonomous agents miscommunicate in critical domains, such as emergency response or autonomous vehicles, who is held responsible? These discussions grounded my understanding of agent communication in real-world stakes and reinforced the need for robust verification techniques.

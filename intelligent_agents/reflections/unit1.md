## **Units 1 - 3 Reflections**


In the opening units, I gained a foundational understanding of what defines an intelligent agent. The collaborative discussion on agent-based systems helped me explore how agents differ from traditional software components, especially in terms of autonomy, cooperation, goal-setting, and reactivity. I also became familiar with different agent architectures, such as reactive and deliberative systems, and began to appreciate their trade-offs in dynamic environments.  

Critically analysing my peers' posts allowed me to compare multi-agent systems with simpler procedural models and question how agents are evaluated in real-world settings. These discussions improved my confidence in communicating key characteristics, such as proactiveness and adaptability. It also made me reflect on the ethical implications of deploying agents in high-risk domains, such as healthcare or finance.  

By the end of these units, I had developed a deeper appreciation of agent design and how architectural choices reflect the nature of the problem space. I started thinking about agents not just as tools, but as context-aware entities that operate within complex environments.

## **Unit 6 Reflections**

This was one of the most memorable units for me. The dialogue modelling activity taught me how to design clear and meaningful conversations between agents. Learning about speech acts and intent helped me better understand how agents can communicate with purpose.


The real breakthrough, however, came from the team development project. I led the team in defining our goals, distributing tasks, and ensuring we aligned on deadlines. This experience sharpened my soft skills in project coordination, but also challenged me to accommodate different communication styles and time zones. We earned a distinction for our final report, which confirmed the strength of our collaboration.  

From a professional standpoint, this unit helped me appreciate what it means to work effectively in a distributed software team. It also gave me real insight into applying knowledge gained to real-world problems with technical complexity and uncertainty. We had to weigh feasibility against scope, and constantly evaluate trade-offs between architecture complexity and clarity of communication.  

Most importantly, I saw how leadership involves balancing task management with support and listening. I emerged from the experience not just more confident in team projects but more grounded in real-world dynamics of distributed agent system development.

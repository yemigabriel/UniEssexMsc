## **Unit 8 Reflections**


This unit helped me understand how sentences are structured and how agents make sense of language. Creating parse trees made it easier to see how rule-based systems interpret commands. I also saw how hard it can be for agents to handle unclear or incomplete input.

The activity improved my understanding of symbolic reasoning and showed why grammar rules are essential for building innovative interfaces. I also realised that parsing mistakes can cause problems in agent communication, especially in chatbots or virtual assistants.

## Peer Response (Abdulhakim) 


Thank you for this well-organised written post. You effectively highlighted the main advantages of KQML, particularly its support for asynchronous and loosely coupled communication, which makes it suitable for distributed multi-agent systems (Labrou, Finin and Peng, 1999).

The contrast with method invocation in languages like Python and Java is also well made. While method calls are efficient in tightly coupled systems, they lack the flexibility needed in environments where agents must operate independently and adapt to changing conditions. The reference to Mammela et al. (2023) strengthens this point by framing loose coupling as a long-standing design principle that supports scalability and modularity.

Your mention of the challenges around consistent semantic interpretation is important. Even with structured performatives, communication can break down if agents do not share a common understanding of the message content (Singh, 1998). Addressing this requires either shared ontologies or protocols that support negotiation and clarification.

The brief reference to agent models like Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) could be expanded further. For example, BDI agents benefit from communication languages that support belief updates or intention sharing, which can improve coordination in team-based tasks (Wooldridge, 2009). Overall, your post presents a clear comparison between ACLs and traditional method invocation, and it brings attention to important factors in designing intelligent agent systems.

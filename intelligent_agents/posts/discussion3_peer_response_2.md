## Peer Response (Abdulhakim) 


Thank you for this contribution to this discussion. You raised an important point about the long-term risks tied to artificial general intelligence (AGI). While tools like DALL·E and ChatGPT are impressive, the broader issues of alignment and interpretability are essential to consider as these systems become more advanced.

Your explanation of alignment is clear and vital. As AI systems become more capable, it’s not enough for them to work well; we need to ensure they are aligned with human values and goals (Ji et al., 2023). If that alignment fails, the consequences could be severe, especially if the system starts acting in ways we don’t expect or understand. You also make a strong case for interpretability. When we don’t know how AI systems make decisions, it becomes difficult to spot errors or harmful patterns (Selbst, 2019). This limits our ability to trust or control these tools, especially in fields such as law, healthcare, or education.

Overall, your post highlights that as AI becomes more powerful, it's not just about what it can do, but also whether it can be trusted to do it safely and ethically.

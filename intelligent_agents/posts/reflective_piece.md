## **Reflection: Intelligent Agents**

### **Introduction**

The Intelligent Agents (IA) module has been one of the most technically engaging and personally rewarding parts of my postgraduate journey. Going into the module, I had a limited understanding of how agent-based systems were applied or developed. I saw intelligent systems as mostly reactive tools, rather than autonomous, communicative, and goal-oriented entities. This module helped me shift that view, offering deep insights into agent architectures, communication, and learning. Using the "What, So What, Now What" framework by Rolfe et al. (2001), I will reflect on my experiences, challenges, achievements, and why they mattered. I will also articulate a plan for leveraging the skills I have acquired in the real world.

### **What**

Throughout the module, we covered agent design from foundational concepts to advanced implementation. Early discussions helped me understand what separates agents from traditional software, including autonomy, social ability, adaptability, and how these traits are implemented using different architectures, such as reactive, deliberative, or hybrid systems (Wooldridge, 2009).  
The collaborative discussions were particularly valuable. In Units 1–3, we debated the suitability of agent-based systems in dynamic environments. These interactions helped me recognise how ethical and professional issues are embedded in system design. Later, in Units 5–7, we explored agent communication languages such as KQML and FIPA ACL, and how misunderstanding or ambiguity could have real-world consequences, especially in high-risk systems like emergency response or finance (Bellifemine et al., 2007).

The most impactful experience came in Unit 6, where I led my team through a collaborative development project. I took responsibility for organising tasks, facilitating communication, and resolving roadblocks. The successful outcome, a distinction, reflected both our teamwork and the practical application of agent design principles in a virtual professional setting.

### **So What**

The most significant shift for me was realising that agent systems are not just about technical implementation, but about embedding systems in environments with uncertainty, risk, and social impact. I began to see how poorly designed agents can cause harm, through bias, miscommunication, or opacity, particularly when deployed without accountability (Dignum, 2018). This deepened my respect for the legal and ethical responsibilities of computing professionals.

Leading the team project also challenged and strengthened my soft skills. I had to balance leadership with collaboration, ensuring that every voice was heard while maintaining project momentum. It taught me that successful agent systems, like successful teams, require clarity of purpose, consistent communication, and the ability to adapt. These lessons are transferable not only to future academic work but to any professional environment.

The discussion on deep learning applications, such as deepfakes, was also eye-opening. I was both amazed by how creative this technology can be and concerned about its potential to mislead. It reminded me that my work in AI is not just technical. It has real consequences for people’s lives. As someone entering this field, I feel a stronger sense of responsibility now: to design with care, to consider ethics early, and to always think about the impact before making an innovation.

### **Now What**

Going forward, I intend to build on this foundation by continuing to experiment with agent development frameworks and by following best practices in both architecture and ethics. I now see myself as someone capable of designing agent-based solutions that are both technically sound and socially responsible, and legally compliant.

In future roles, whether in research or industry, I will advocate for the inclusion of ethical reviews, bias checks, and transparency standards in the development of intelligent systems. I will also draw on my leadership experience in virtual teams to better manage distributed projects, especially where collaboration and communication are essential to success.

The final research agent project in Unit 11 brought together everything I learned: design logic, communication flow, environmental interaction, and ethical constraints. It gave me confidence that I can conceptualise, build, and explain a functional intelligent system with practical value. More importantly, it reminded me why I am on this path: to create technology that is not only innovative but also meaningful and fair.

This module didn’t just improve my technical skills. It helped shape the kind of computing professional I want to be: one who values clarity, accountability, and human impact.

## Peer Response (Guilherme) 

This gives a clear overview of agent-based systems (ABS) and traces its development well. The definition of agents is easy to understand, with good references to foundational works like Wooldridge and Jennings (1995). The historical context of ABS development, particularly its recognition as a distinct programming paradigm in the 1990s, helps situate the technology within the broader AI landscape.

This discussion does a good job of showing how versatile ABS can be, with examples in robotics, logistics, and cybersecurity, which highlight its potential to transform industries. The discussion highlights how ABS can transform sectors that rely on automation, large-scale data processing, and time-sensitive decisions. The point about ABS reducing risks to human life and aiding in critical decision-making is also spot on.

Ethical concerns and the potential for bias in AI systems are also briefly mentioned. While the risks are acknowledged, mentioning some practical solutions for addressing them would make the discussion even more robust. For example, exploring solutions like improving training data quality and implementing ethical guidelines for ABS development would strengthen the discussion (Wallach and Allen, 2009; Yadav, 2023). Additionally, enhancing transparency and accountability in decision-making processes could help address potential biases and increase trust in these systems.

Overall, it’s an informative read that gives a solid view of ABS’s potential and applications. It also thoughtfully recognises the challenges that come with its development and deployment.

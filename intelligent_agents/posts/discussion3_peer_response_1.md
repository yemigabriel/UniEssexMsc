## Peer Response (Guilherme) 



Thank you for your well-balanced post. I appreciate how you highlighted both the creative possibilities and the ethical concerns that come with generative AI technologies. 

The point you made about AI contributing to cultural preservation is fascinating. Tools that can simulate the voices of late artists or replicate stylistic patterns have clear potential in education, restoration, and memory work (Culafic, Popovic and Cakic, 2025). At the same time, your concerns about diminishing individual creativity and job displacement are valid. As Öztaş and Arda (2025) note, the growing reliance on automated content may shift how we define and value creative labour. If AI is used mainly to reproduce existing patterns or styles, there’s a risk that originality could be deprioritised in both art and commercial content.

Your mention of copyright and authenticity also raises a significant legal and ethical point. Recreating an artist’s voice, style, or persona without their consent, or that of their estate, challenges traditional frameworks of authorship and intellectual property (Yang and Zhang, 2024). As generative tools become more accessible, these boundaries will only become more complicated to manage.

Overall, your post effectively frames the debate: the same technologies that can empower creativity can also undermine it if not used thoughtfully. Moving forward, clearer policies around authorship, consent, and responsible use will be necessary to support a healthy balance between innovation and respect for human creators.

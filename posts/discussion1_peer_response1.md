## Peer Response (Marwa Alkuwari) 

Your discussion on the 2017 WannaCry incident is insightful and highlights how the interconnectedness of modern systems can unfortunately increase the risk of widespread disruptions. The WannaCry ransomware exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, encrypted files and demanded a ransom for the decryption keys. This incident largely affected outdated systems as a patch for the vulnerability had already been released 2 months prior (Microsoft Defender Security Research Team, 2017). Proper patch management processes, especially for critical security updates, would have stopped the spread of WannaCry.

  

Additionally, WannaCry spread rapidly through internal networks of organisations that were not properly segmented. With network segmentation, clear boundaries are set up with appropriate access controls (Kovács, 2022). By implementing network segmentation, ransomware attacks like WannaCry are limited to a smaller subset of the network, avoiding critical areas such as medical records. Organisations must also invest in cybersecurity training programs for staff. Ransomware, like WannaCry are usually delivered via phishing emails with malicious links. Adequate and regular training can help raise awareness about phishing and mitigate the threats ransomware poses.

  

Further global spread of WannaCry was halted by Marcus Hutchins, a British cybersecurity expert (Greenberg, 2020). This underscores the importance of investing in, and growing cybersecurity communities to help respond quickly to global cyber threats. Ultimately, organisations and governments must invest in strengthening security processes, and quick recovery plans as risks grow in Industry 4.0

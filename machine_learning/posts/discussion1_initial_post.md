## Collaborative Discussion 1: Initial Post

The Fourth Industrial Revolution has rapidly driven the adoption of advanced technologies, significantly boosting productivity across various sectors (World Economic Forum, 2023). The adoption of these technologies also exposes organisations to technical and cybersecurity challenges. While beneficial, the interconnectedness of modern systems increases the risks of cascading technical failure. The recent Crowdstrike outage in 2024 is an unfortunate example of how critical technical failures can cause widespread disruption in various sectors.

  

On July 19, 2024, Crowdstrike, a prominent security vendor for Microsoft and other companies, released a faulty configuration update that led to the crash of 8.5 million Windows devices (Weston, 2024). The outage caused major airlines in the United States to ground, delay, and cancel over 10,000 flights. It also affected financial institutions, healthcare companies, broadcast outlets, and public transit. The economic damage to Fortune 500 companies is estimated at $5.4 billion (Gorelick and Bloomberg, 2024).

  

The Crowdstrike incident underscores the importance of extensive testing, phased rollouts, and automated rollback mechanisms as new technologies are deployed. Organisations must also have comprehensive backup and recovery plans for their clients in the event of outages. Additionally, Crowdstrikeâ€™s popular Cybersecurity artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Falcon, could have been expanded to help predict potential conflicts with new updates. AI models could help catch configurations that may break in production before they are deployed. All these may have prevented or minimised the impact of the incident.

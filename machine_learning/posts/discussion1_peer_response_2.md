## Peer Response (Noora Alboinin) 

This discussion on the 2017 Equifax data breach emphasises organisations' need for proper patch management as they engage in the fourth industrial revolution (Bond et al., 2022). The vulnerability in Equifax’s web application framework, Apache Struts, had a patch available months before the breach. By failing to apply this critical security update, attackers exploited the vulnerability. Regular security audits, assessments, and patch management could have prevented the data breach.

Additionally, stronger encryption practices could have lessened the damage. Sensitive data like social security numbers and credit card details that were exposed could have been better encrypted, making the stolen data useless to hackers. Multi-factor authentication could have also limited unauthorised access to critical systems. Segmenting data based on sensitivity could have limited hackers from gaining access to all information from just one exposure.

While security incidents come with the benefits of the fourth industrial revolution, organisations do better when proactive measures are taken with transparency and accountability. Equifax failed to communicate transparently in the wake of the data breach and suffered reputational damage. Notifying exposed customers sooner and implementing remedial action steps, like credit freezes, would have lessened the impact on customers (Moore, 2017).

With the rapid technological advancement characteristic of Industry 4.0, organisations must be proactive and demonstrate responsibility with security plans. Transparency and adherence to strong security standards and processes can help organisations prevent and manage security incidents.

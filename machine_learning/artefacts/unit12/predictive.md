**Industry: Financial**

I chose the predictive models because they are designed to forecast future events based on historical data. This makes them valuable in the financial sector where data-driven decision-making is crucial. They can assess risks, the likelihood of fraud, and enhance customer experience. Using techniques such as regression analysis and neural networks, financial organisations can make informed decisions based on huge volumes of customers, transactions, markets, and economic data.

They help anticipate trends and manage risks in an industry sensitive to fluctuations in the market.

## **Action Plan**

```
_Where do I want to be by the end of this period/year? What do I want to be doing? (Include as many learning needs as required to achieve agreed objectives)_

<div style="overflow-x: auto; min-width: 120vw;">

| What do I want/need to learn? Provide a specific description of the desired changes (e.g. skills to gain, knowledge to acquire, topics/themes/content to cover) | What do I have to do to achieve this? Some examples, a new/ongoing course, conference, self-development (like wider research or reading), coaching/mentoring, job shadowing | What resources or support will I need? Some examples, teaching staff support, library support, student advisor support, line manager, etc. | How will I measure success? Some examples, appraisals, course assessments, team feedback, tutor feedback | Target dates for review and completion Note that these need to be realistic/achievable |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  I want to deepen my understanding of research methodology.   | I’ll have to complete all final module artefacts and reflective assignments. | Currently have access to academic databases (via the university) and the university library for relevant literature. I’m also taking advantage of tutor feedback on summatives. | Positive feedback and grades on module submissions. | April 21, 2025: Submission of all module assignments and research artefacts |
|  I need to improve data visualisation and interpretation skills, especially using Python and statistical tools.   | I have already started a Machine Learning Specialisation on Coursera to help with this. Also, practising coding a lot. | I’ve already invested in tools to improve programming and visualisation such as Github CoPilot. | More positive feedback on my Github repository | May 30, 2025: Complete Machine Learning Specialisation on Coursera. |
|  I want to develop confidence in communicating research findings clearly through presentations and writing.   | I intend to start early drafts of a research paper based on my proposal. | I’ll need support from my project supervisor in my future project module. | Completion of a first draft of a publishable paper.   | June, 2025 – First draft of research paper ready |
|  I want to strengthen critical thinking and reflection when evaluating sources or peer work.   | I’ll schedule time weekly for reading, analysis, and writing. I also currently use Paperpile to manage sources effectively.  | I’ll need to use my time management tools (e.g. Pomodoro timer) more effectively. I’ll also need to carve out time and quiet to concentrate on academic tasks. | Confirmation of interest from one or more potential PhD supervisors. Also, I would have gained improved confidence and reduced stress when interpreting academic material or writing reflections.  | July 2025: Contact at least two potential PhD supervisors. Begin refining a paper for submission to a conference.  |

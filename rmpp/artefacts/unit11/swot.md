| **External origin**<br>*(attributes of the environment)* | **Opportunities**<br>1. Access to quality academic resources and tutor feedback.<br>2. Growing interest and funding opportunities in responsible AI and healthcare.<br>3. Potential for international research collaboration, especially PhD opportunities.<br>4. Platforms for publishing student research (conferences, journals).<br>5. Flexible online learning environment. | **Threats**<br>1. Competitive academic publishing landscape.<br>2. Uncertainty around future research funding or PhD admission.<br>3. Risk of burnout if workload becomes unsustainable.<br>4. Limited availability of local datasets for Nigeria-specific healthcare AI research.<br>5. Reductions in global health or development aid (e.g., USAID) may impact international research funding and collaboration, especially for healthcare AI in low-resource settings. |

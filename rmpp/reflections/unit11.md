## **Unit 11 Reflections**

_(123 words)_

The SWOT analysis and action plan helped me reflect honestly on my professional development. I became more intentional about building my confidence in qualitative methods and public communication. I am also keenly aware of threats and opportunities for growth. The skills matrix also revealed that my growth isn't just technical - it's about being a responsible researcher aware of the broader context in which my work operates. I’m excited about my journey so far and what’s ahead.

This reflection helped me recognise the skills I need for future research. I also gained clarity on how to plan achievable goals within tight timelines. Revisiting the learning outcomes showed me how each unit contributed to broader competencies, especially around critical evaluation, academic integrity, and ethical practice.

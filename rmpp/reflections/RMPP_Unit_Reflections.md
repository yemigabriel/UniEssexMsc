## Unit 1 – Introduction to Ethics in Computing *(140 words)*  
This unit introduced core ethical concepts that underpin professional practice in computing. The case on generative AI and ethical boundaries helped me recognise how innovation often outpaces regulation. I reflected deeply on the role of computing professionals in navigating the grey areas between creativity, compliance, and harm. Understanding the ACM Code of Ethics laid the foundation for later discussions on transparency, fairness, and accountability. I also began appreciating how emerging technologies demand critical ethical reflection from the outset.

## Unit 2 – Professional Codes and Case Analysis *(130 words)*  
Through collaborative discussion around medical device safety, I saw how abstract codes translate into real-world dilemmas. This helped me see professional conduct not just as guidelines, but as daily practice. Comparing the ACM and BCS codes deepened my appreciation for integrity, diligence, and the weight of decision-making in high-stakes environments. I started becoming more comfortable critically applying ethical principles to scenarios, not just describing them.

## Unit 3 – Research Design and Collaboration *(120 words)*  
This unit helped me connect ethical thinking with research design. Reviewing my research proposal taught me how much early-stage decisions affect later reliability and transparency. The collaborative summary task helped me synthesise diverse perspectives on ethical reporting and exposed me to new views on statistical responsibility. I began to see collaboration as a tool for improving ethical rigour.

## Unit 4 – Literature Review Planning *(90 words)*  
Drafting the outline for my literature review gave me early clarity on research scope and framing. It taught me how to position a research question within an existing field while identifying genuine gaps. Structuring the outline also helped me appreciate the link between sound literature planning and long-term academic integrity.

## Unit 5 – Survey Ethics and Misuse *(120 words)*  
This case study helped me explore how something as routine as a survey can become ethically problematic. Analysing examples like Cambridge Analytica and the Flo app, I saw how informed consent, data transparency, and participant trust are often undermined in subtle ways. It highlighted the legal and social responsibilities of data collection — especially when the insights can be monetised or misused.

## Unit 6 – Summary Measures and Descriptive Statistics *(90 words)*  
Working with data summaries improved my confidence in interpreting measures like mean, median, and interquartile range. More importantly, I saw how improper or selective use of descriptive statistics can lead to misleading conclusions. This made me more conscious of data presentation as an ethical act, not just a technical step.

## Unit 7 – Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing *(130 words)*  
This unit was a turning point for me in understanding statistical reasoning. Conducting t-tests and interpreting p-values gave me a deeper appreciation of data uncertainty. I also reflected on the ethical risks of over-interpreting statistical significance. The link between transparency in analysis and responsible research became clearer, especially in health-related studies.

## Unit 8 – Research Proposal Drafting *(140 words)*  
Preparing a detailed research proposal helped me synthesise everything learned so far — ethical reasoning, literature evaluation, and statistical planning. Writing my outline also sharpened my thinking around research feasibility, participant impact, and data limitations. I felt the real weight of academic responsibility and the importance of aligning methodology with ethical principles.

## Unit 9 – Data Visualisation and Interpretation *(100 words)*  
Creating charts and histograms taught me that how data is visualised shapes interpretation. I became more aware of how visual framing can either clarify or obscure findings. This unit tied in with earlier ethical discussions by showing how even neutral-looking visuals can carry implicit bias or mislead viewers.

## Unit 10 – Research Proposal Presentation *(120 words)*  
Presenting my research topic challenged me to explain complex ideas clearly and responsibly. I saw how important it is to communicate limitations, assumptions, and relevance. This unit helped me connect the dots between academic research and real-world impact, especially in health contexts like breast cancer diagnosis in Nigeria. I gained more confidence in articulating the value and risks of my proposal.

## Unit 11 – Skills Mapping and Planning *(110 words)*  
The SWOT and action plan helped me reflect honestly on my professional development. I became more intentional about building my confidence in qualitative methods and public communication. Mapping skills also revealed that my growth isn't just technical — it's about being a responsible practitioner aware of the broader context in which my work operates.

## Unit 12 – Final Reflection *(110 words)*  
This closing unit brought everything together. I realised how far I’ve come in thinking critically about research ethics, statistical integrity, and academic responsibility. More than learning isolated skills, I developed a mindset of care, curiosity, and caution. These reflections are not just academic tasks but evidence of how I now approach research with deeper awareness of its societal and ethical dimensions.

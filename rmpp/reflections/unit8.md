## **Unit 8 Reflections**

_(160 words)_


Writing my outline sharpened my thinking around research feasibility, participant impact, and dataset limitations. Developing my proposal on explainable AI in breast cancer diagnosis brought ethical tensions into focus, particularly around bias, trust, and access. I had to consider not just what could be done technically, but what should be done socially and ethically.  I have had to consider the role of transparency in proposal writing, especially when dealing with health data.

The posts from my peers in the second collaborative studies were also engaging and a delight to read. I gained new perspectives on ethical obligations when presenting statistical results from Nimi and Tarek. Overall, my sense of obligation and awareness of ethical issues surrounding data interpretation has deepened.

Working on my worksheet exercises was initially confusing, partly because of incorrect file names on the VLE. I got past this confusion on a closer look at the questions and files. I have become more confident in my statistical reasoning.

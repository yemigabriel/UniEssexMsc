## **Unit 12 Reflections**

_(81 words)_

This final unit helped me see how much I’ve grown. I’m no longer just learning skills; I’m learning how to think and act like a researcher. I now approach research with more care, curiosity, and awareness of its impact. These reflections showed me how important it is to question assumptions, stay honest, and communicate clearly. I feel more confident in my path, not just as a student but as someone ready to do meaningful and ethical work in the real world.

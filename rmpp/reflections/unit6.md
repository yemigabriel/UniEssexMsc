## **Unit 6 Reflections**

_(85 words)_


This unit did not have artefacts to submit. I revised my initial draft of the literature review assignment. I had to balance including only relevant sources while staying within the word limit. Managing my time was also challenging due to the demands of work, family, and a pending assignment from another module I was taking at the same time. I found myself reflecting on my “why” and using that sense of purpose to stay motivated and give my best effort in the literature review assignment.

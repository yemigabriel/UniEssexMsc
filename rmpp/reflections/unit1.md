## **Unit 1 Reflections**

_(183 words)_


This unit introduced core ethical concepts that underpin professional practice in computing. The reflective activity on ethics in the age of generative AI helped me recognise how innovation can often outpaces regulation. I reflected on the role of computing professionals in navigating the grey areas between creativity, compliance, and harm. I questioned my use of AI in code completion, for instance. Where does my originality end, with AI tools embedded in so many modern code editors? 

Although I joined the collaborative discussion late, due to balancing different responsibilities, understanding the ACM Code of Ethics laid the foundation for later discussions on transparency, fairness, and accountability. I also began appreciating how emerging technologies demand critical ethical reflection from the outset. The emphasis on accountability made me think about how even seemingly passive design decisions can have unintended consequences. This has helped me understand that computing professionals are not neutral bystanders in the deployment of technology. We are active participants in shaping how technologies affect lives. This has influenced how I now evaluate ethical considerations within technical projects, particularly those that may impact public welfare.

## **Unit 9 Reflections**

_(92 words)_


I worked on the chart worksheets in this unit. I learned that how data is visualised can shape interpretation.  Visual framing can either clarify or obscure findings. This unit tied in with earlier ethical discussions by showing how even neutral-looking visuals can carry implicit bias or mislead viewers. I have learned to use histograms, clustered column charts to properly tell a story about the data.

I also worked on the summary post for the second collaborative discussion, building on peer posts and my improved awareness of ethical responsibilities as a computing professional

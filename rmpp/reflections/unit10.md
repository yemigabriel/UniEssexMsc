## **Unit 10 Reflections**

_(117 words)_

Submitting the final draft of my research proposal challenged me to clearly and responsibly explain complex ideas. I learnt how important it is to communicate limitations, background, and the relevance of my research. This unit helped me connect the dots between academic research and real-world impact, especially in health contexts such as breast cancer diagnosis in Nigeria. I gained more confidence in articulating the value and risks of my proposal. 

This experience has strengthened my communication skills, which will be essential for future academic presentations and interdisciplinary collaboration. This unit made the link between ethics and communication more concrete. Getting a distinction and positive feedback from my tutor also made me more confident in my academic journey.

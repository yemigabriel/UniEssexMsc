## **Unit 4 Reflections**

_(109 words)_


Drafting the outline for my literature review gave me early clarity on research scope and framing. It taught me how to position a research question within an existing field while identifying genuine gaps. I learned that critical evaluation of sources isnâ€™t just about summarising content, but assessing methodological quality and relevance. Structuring the outline also helped me appreciate the link between sound literature planning and long-term academic integrity. 

I also realised how important it is to use peer-reviewed and regionally relevant literature, especially in areas like health research, where cultural and infrastructural contexts vary widely. Overall, this strengthened my ability to appraise existing literature for academic and practical value.

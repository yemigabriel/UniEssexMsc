## **Unit 2 Reflections**

_(179 words)_


Through the continued collaborative discussion around the ACM case study of medical device safety, I saw how abstract codes translate into real-world dilemmas. This helped me see professional conduct not just as guidelines, but as daily practice. Comparing the ACM and BCS codes deepened my appreciation for diligence and the weight of decision-making in high-stakes environments. The case study made it clear that harm does not have to be intentional for it to be impactful. Systems need to be designed with diverse users in mind.

The posts from my peers prompted me to think about the role of whistleblowing and the tension between loyalty to my employer and public safety. This unit also highlighted how professional standards and legal expectations can sometimes diverge, and that critical thinking is needed to balance them. I am more confident in my ability to identify breaches in conduct. I have also learned to frame recommendations within both ethical and legal frameworks, particularly in the context of public health technology. This is vital as I intend to pursue further research in AI and healthcare.

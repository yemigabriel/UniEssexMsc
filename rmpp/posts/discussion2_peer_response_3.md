## Peer Response (Andrius) 



Hi Andrius,

Your post presents a well-rounded reflection on Abi’s ethical and professional responsibilities. I particularly liked your point about the influence his actions could have on broader research norms. If statistical practitioners begin to prioritise selective reporting over transparency, it could set a dangerous precedent and weaken public trust in research outcomes (Resnik, 2020).

You also raise a valid suggestion in proposing further studies or third-party involvement. That could help Abi maintain objectivity while reducing the likelihood that his work is misused. I’d add that including a clear methods section and explicitly stating limitations within the report could reinforce transparency, even if only part of the findings are shared publicly (American Statistical Association, 2018).

The legal perspective you offered is also critical. As you noted, if misleading conclusions are published, both Abi and the manufacturer could violate consumer protection laws. Even if Abi is not directly responsible for publication decisions, the ethical burden still lies with him to communicate findings thoroughly and carefully (Williams and Patel, 2022).

Thank you for your thoughtful analysis. It reinforces how ethical conduct in research is not just about technical accuracy, but about being mindful of how results can be interpreted and used beyond the lab.

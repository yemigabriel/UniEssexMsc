## Peer Response (Nima) 


Hi Nima,

Your post does a great job outlining the ethical, legal, and professional layers of Abi’s dilemma. I especially appreciated your emphasis on scientific integrity and how selective reporting, even without altering data, can still violate ethical standards. Your reference to Smith and Johnson (2021) helped reinforce the idea that transparency must take precedence over commercial pressure.

I also agree with your point that the social impact extends beyond Abi and the manufacturer. If consumers are misled, the damage can ripple into public trust in both the institute and research as a whole. Anderson and White’s (2022) work makes a strong case for why ethical reporting is not just a procedural obligation but a safeguard for public health.

Your outline of Abi’s options was balanced and practical. Escalating to an ethics committee or seeking independent review seems like a constructive route if internal reporting fails. I would also add that documenting all communication and decision points can protect Abi professionally, especially if the issue escalates later (Resnik, 2020).

Thanks for such a well-reasoned contribution. It strengthens the case that ethical responsibility doesn’t end at the technical accuracy of results. It also includes how those results are framed and communicated.

## Collaborative Discussion 1: Summary Post  


Reflecting on the ACM case studies and engaging with my peers’ posts has deepened my understanding of how ethical principles apply in real-world computing contexts. From life-critical medical devices to workplace conduct, these discussions have shown that ethical dilemmas in computing are not abstract. They are embedded in decisions that affect safety, dignity, and public trust.

The Medical Implant Risk Analysis case stood out due to its combination of technical risk and ethical accountability. Both John and Zukiswa offered thoughtful analyses of Corazón’s actions, highlighting the dangers posed by the hardcoded initialisation value. Even though the vulnerability was rated low risk, its presence in an implantable medical device requires careful ethical consideration. This reflects ACM Principles 1.2 (avoid harm), 2.5 (thorough evaluation), and 1.3 (honesty and trustworthiness) (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018). Responsible disclosure is not just a legal requirement but a moral responsibility when lives are at stake (Johnson, 2018; Denning, Matsuoka and Kohno, 2017).

Oi Lam Siu’s analysis of the Abusive Workplace Behaviour case reinforced the importance of ethical leadership. Max’s actions violate ACM Principle 1.4 and the BCS Code of Conduct, which require fairness and respect in professional environments (British Computer Society, 2022). The behaviour described may also fall under workplace harassment as defined in Section 26 of the UK Equality Act 2010 (Equality Act, 2010).

These conversations have clarified that ethical computing is not only about technical competence. It requires awareness, integrity, and the willingness to prioritise the public good over personal or organisational interests. I now feel better equipped to apply these values as a computing professional.

## Peer Response (John) 

Hi John, thank you for this insightful post. You’ve done a great job of highlighting both Corazón’s ethical strengths and areas where its practices fell short. I especially appreciated your references to ACM principles 2.9 and 3.7 (ACM, n.d.). Indeed, the company’s proactive approach to encryption, bug bounty programs, and research reflects a serious commitment to secure development (Gal-Or et al. 2024).

That said, I think you're also right to flag the hardcoded initialisation value as a significant ethical concern. Even if the risk was later assessed as negligible, its presence in a life-critical medical device underscores the ongoing responsibility to uphold Principle 1.2 (avoid harm) and 2.5 (conduct thorough evaluations). Vulnerabilities in such systems, even those that seem minor, can still compromise public trust and professional integrity.

I would also argue that this case highlights the importance of being honest and transparent. Corazón’s internal acknowledgement of the issue is a good step, but there’s a broader question of whether patients and stakeholders should be made more explicitly aware of such risks. Your reference to the BCS Code of Conduct is spot on. Upholding the profession means addressing both technical flaws and ethical grey areas with complete transparency. Thanks again for raising these points.

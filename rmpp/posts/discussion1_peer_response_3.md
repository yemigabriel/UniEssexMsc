## Peer Response (Zukiswa) 


Hi Zukiswa, thank you for your engaging post. I appreciate how you’ve connected the Medical Implant Risk Analysis case to the human stakes involved in developing life-critical technologies. Your reference to regulatory bodies like the FDA and MHRA adds essential context, showing that this ethical dilemma also carries profound legal implications.

Your post raises a challenging question: What should a computing professional do when they discover a critical vulnerability in a device? This sits at the intersection of Principle 1.2 (Avoid harm) and Principle 1.3 (Be honest and trustworthy) of the ACM Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018). It also brings up the often-overlooked issue of whistleblowing. While reporting internally is ideal, when organisations fail to act, responsible disclosure becomes a moral obligation (Johnson, 2018). I would also highlight Principle 1.7, to “honour confidentiality.” If a flaw allows unauthorised access to personal health data, this too becomes an ethical and legal violation, especially under data protection laws like GDPR or HIPAA.

Finally, I found your framing of the dilemma, between corporate backlash and public safety, very compelling. It reminds us that ethical computing is not just about code, but about courage, communication, and care. Thanks again for your thoughtful contribution.

## **Chart Worksheets and Interpretations**

    **Interpretation:** The chart for Area 2 shows that Brand B is the most preferred, followed by ‘Other’ brands, with Brand A the least chosen. The clustered column chart makes the comparison clearer: Brand A and Brand B have visibly higher bars in Area 2 than in Area 1, while the bar for ‘Other’ is taller in Area 1, indicating greater preference for alternative brands there. Overall, the visuals suggest a shift toward mainstream brands in Area 2 and more brand diversity or fragmentation in Area 1.

    **Interpretation:** The chart compares flower presence across two locations. In Location A, 8 observations were “Absent,” 22 were “Sparse,” and 26 were “Abundant.” In contrast, Location B had 20 “Absent,” 14 “Sparse,” and only 10 “Abundant.” This shows that Location A had higher overall flower presence, particularly in the “Abundant” category, while Location B had more instances of flower absence, suggesting poorer growth conditions. The distribution clearly indicates that Location A supports more consistent and richer floral growth than Location B.



- [Exercise 9.3B](../artefacts/sheets/Exe_9_3B.xlsx)

    **Interpretation:** The chart for Diet B is right-skewed, with its peak at 3 kg (≈ 30%) and a gradual decline in frequency as weight loss increases. There is more variability at the lower end of the weight loss scale, and fewer participants achieved significant results beyond 7 kg. This suggests less consistency and lower overall effectiveness compared to Diet A. While both diets led to some weight loss, Diet A appears more effective and consistent, producing greater average results with less variability. Diet B had a wider spread of outcomes, with more participants losing only a small amount of weight.

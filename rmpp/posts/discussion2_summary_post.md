## Collaborative Discussion 2: Summary Post  

This discussion highlighted the complex ethical responsibilities of researchers and computing professionals when handling data that may be interpreted in multiple ways. Abi’s case illustrates how statistical accuracy alone does not guarantee ethical reporting. Several peers rightly pointed out that omitting unfavourable but valid results can still constitute misrepresentation, especially when public health is involved (Resnik, 2020). Even when the data is correct, the selective framing of analyses can distort conclusions and mislead stakeholders.

Across posts, there was strong agreement that Abi has an ethical obligation to present both positive and negative findings. As the American Statistical Association (2018) notes, professionals must avoid bias in selecting statistical methods or interpreting results. Presenting a balanced report ensures transparency and respects the public interest.

Legal concerns were also widely discussed. Under laws such as the UK Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations (GOV.UK, 2008) and similar regulations in other countries (Bello et al., 2012), the omission of material information in product evaluations could be considered deceptive. If Abi knowingly withholds results that suggest harm, both he and the manufacturer may be exposed to liability.

Several posts proposed constructive courses of action, including seeking ethical review, clearly documenting all analyses, and suggesting further independent testing. These options reflect professional responsibility not only to the client but to society, as emphasised by the ACM Code of Ethics (2018).

This discussion deepened my understanding of how ethical decision-making extends beyond data analysis. The way findings are presented matters as much as the statistical methods themselves. Abi’s case is a reminder that computing professionals must prioritise public trust and integrity over commercial interests.
